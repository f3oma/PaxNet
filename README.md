# PaxNet & PaxMan

This repo houses F3 Omaha's PAX management and scheduling tool. The new tool will provide admins and Site Q's the ability to both add new and search existing PAX.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Further help
